I want you to write a script that looks up MTG cards from database.json and finds similar matching cards in lotr.json, and writes them to a converted.json.

The json contains data such as this:
[
    {
        "name": "The One Ring",
        "type": "Legendary Artifact",
        "manaCost": "{4}",
        "rarity": "mythic",
        "setCode": "LTR",
        "text": "Indestructible\nWhen The One Ring enters the battlefield, if you cast it, you gain protection from everything until your next turn.\nAt the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life for each burden counter on The One Ring.\n{T}: Put a burden counter on The One Ring, then draw a card for each burden counter on The One Ring.",
        "power": "",
        "toughness": ""
    }
]

You will make fuzzy matches between the database and lotr cards using:
1. Similar types (we can be very fuzzy here)
2. Same mana costs (in terms of total value, and in colors of mana)
3. Same rarity
4. Similar power and toughness (we can be slightly fuzzy here, unless there is simply no match)
5. If it does not cost mana, then it probably produces mana, so we need to read the text field for any types and colors of mana it produces.
6. If we have weird cases, such as a artifact or colorless card that has no similarity, then just find a match using white mana as a matching value.
7. If we have cards with really high mana costs that are not found in lotr, just pick the highest mana cost card that matches the similar colors.
8. If you come across something weird like {U/P}, ignore it and treat it like a colorless mana.
9. Also store the setCode in the json as we will need it later.
10. Treat planeswalkers as powerful, rare creatures for conversion purposes, so just pick a strong, rare creature from the same color of cards as the planeswalker.
11. When we have two colors back to back like this: 'W', 'W' this is just W but twice (meaning 2 W mana).

The script should stop if no similar conversion was found and print which card did not find a match, however we want to increase the fuzziness of our search as we dont find matches so that way we never have a missing match.
We should print why a match was not found when we exit as well, especially when we are finding the powerful creatures or planeswalker replacements.
